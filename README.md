<h2>A collection of Card games (and Minesweeper) intended to titilate the user.</h2>
<h3>Brief Description</h3>
<p>I think that the logic behind building a card game (blackjack especially) is perfect for someone starting out in a language. I want to expand my knowledge of javascript, html, and css and this project is the perfect opportunity!</p>
<img>(for future use)[My image](username.github.com/repository/img/image.jpg)</img><p>Not sure how to get images in here...</p>
<p>This project will include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Blackjack</li>
    <li>Poker</li>
    <li>Minesweeper</li>
  </ul>
<h4>Challenges</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Edge cases (making my code robust)</li>
  <li>Visuals(CSS...)</li>
  <li>Time(as usual)</li>
  <li>Not knowing if I am overextending myself until I already invest too much time in a new feature</li>
 </ul>
<h4>Things still to finish (in order from best to worst...):</h4>
<ol>
  <li>Right Clicking for Minesweeper</li>
  <li>Making Minesweeper look better than it does (aka not a jumble of squares...)</li>
  <li>Fleshing out the logic for Blackjack</li>
  <li>Logic for Poker</li>
  <li>Creating the visuals for the card games</li>
  <li>Cleaning up the code and making it readable...to my future self...</li>
</ol>

<h4>Ideas</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Have a finishing 'animation' for Minesweeper when the bomb appears</li>
  <li>Cleaning up Minesweeper code / breaking up the classes a bit</li>
  <li>'Card dealing' animation? Something other than just having new cards appear when dealt</li>
  <li>'Double down", "Splitting", "All those annoying-to-code features of Blackjack</li>
  <li>I really want to have some sort of a roulette but just thinking about managing the speed of the table spin / the ball bouncing around gives me a headache...</li>
  <li>Betting!</li>
  <li>A more robust login system</li>
</ul>
