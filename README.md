## A collection of Card games (and Minesweeper) intended to titilate the user.
### Brief Description
<p>I think that the logic behind building a card game (blackjack especially) is perfect for someone starting out in a language. I want to expand my knowledge of javascript, html, and css and this project is the perfect opportunity!</p>
<img>(for future use)[My image](username.github.com/repository/img/image.jpg)</img><p>Not sure how to get images in here...</p>
<p>This project will include:</p>
* Blackjack
* Poker
* Minesweeper

#### Challenges

* Edge cases (making my code robust)
* Visuals(CSS...)
* Time(as usual)
* Not knowing if I am overextending myself until I already invest too much time in a new feature

#### Things still to finish (in order from best to worst...):
1. Right Clicking for Minesweeper
2. Making Minesweeper look better than it does (aka not a jumble of squares...)
3. Fleshing out the logic for Blackjack
4. Logic for Poker
5. Creating the visuals for the card games
6. Cleaning up the code and making it readable...to my future self...


#### Ideas
* Have a finishing 'animation' for Minesweeper when the bomb appears
* Cleaning up Minesweeper code / breaking up the classes a bit
* 'Card dealing' animation? Something other than just having new cards appear when dealt
* 'Double down", "Splitting", "All those annoying-to-code features of Blackjack
* I really want to have some sort of a roulette but just thinking about managing the speed of the table spin / the ball bouncing around gives me a headache...
* Betting!
* A more robust login system
